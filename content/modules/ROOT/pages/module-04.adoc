= Advisor in Satellite while connected.

In this module you will look at the advisor service of Insights.   
Advisor is the original Insights service that focuses on predictive and proactive recommendations that can help keep your systems running smoothly.
The Advisor service is available via the Hybrid Cloud Console or inside of the Satellite user interface. 
In this module you will use the Satellite user interface to identify and resolve an issue.  
In this module you are still connected to Insights and the analysis is being done in the Hybrid Cloud Console.
This module will help you see the difference between the Insights section of the Satellite user interface when using the connected services at console.redhat.com versus using the Insights section of the Satellite user interface when Insights is being used in on premise mode.

Your RHEL hosts are RHEL 9 systems that were created with a few packages pre-installed.  One of these is postgresql server, an object-relational database management system.  The postgresql server was started on the host, but no other actions have been taken for the postgresql environment.


== Viewing system recommendations

Please use a web browser to navigate to your {workshop_satellite_url}[Satellite's user interface,window=read-later]. +

Log into the Satellite with the following credentials: +

User:
[source,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
{workshop_satellite_user_name}
----

Password:
[source,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
{workshop_satellite_user_password}
----

Once logged in, on the left hand navigation bar expand the Insights menu. 
You will see `Inventory Upload` and `Recommendations`.  Select `Recommendations`.

Depending on how long your lab has been running, the page might be empty - We want to sync the Recommendations with the ones on the Hybrid Cloud Console.
To do this, locate the Remediate button in the upper right.  Next to that are three vertical dots - click the three dots and select `Sync recommendations`.

image::Sat_Insights_Connected_Sync.png[Sat_Insights_Connected_Sync.png,100%,100%]

If your page was already populated you may not see any difference.  If your page was blank, after a few seconds the view will update and Advisor recommendations will be displayed in the Satellite UI.  +  
These are the same ones that you would see in the Advisor service of the Hybrid Cloud Console.  
In this instance the analysis is being done on the Hybrid Cloud Console and the results are being synchronized with your Red Hat Satellite.

NOTE: While you see results from both hosts, only work on `node-{guid}-1.example.com` in this module.  You  will use `node-{guid}-2.example.com` in the next module.

== Recommendations on your system

Let’s look at a host specific view. +

* In the left hand navigation menu of Red Hat Satellite, click Hosts then All Hosts +
* Look at the recommendations column on `node-{guid}-1.example.com`. +
* You should see 4 recommendations listed in the table. +

image::Sat_Insights_Connected_AllHosts.png[Sat_Insights_Connected_AllHosts.png,80%,80%]

* Click on `node-{guid}-1.example.com`. +
* The overview shows you details about the host.  Near the bottom of the page (You will likely need to scroll down), one of the widgets shown is called `Total risks`. +


image::Sat_Insights_Connected_Widget.png[Sat_Insights_Connected_Widget.png,60%,60%]

* This information is being populated by the Insights advisor service. +
* You have two moderate and two important risks, but no low or critical risks. +
* Observe that the risk levels are hyperlinks - do not click, but you should know that you could select the risk category from this widget to see a filtered view of the risks. +
* Scroll back to the top of the page, and click the `Insights` tab. +

image::Sat_Insights_Connected_InsightsTab.png[Sat_Insights_Connected_InsightsTab.png,100%,100%]

* Here you see the four recommendations listed that are specific to this host.
* You will see a recommendation for postgresql listed: +
`The postgresql database performance decreases when the tuned best practices are not applied` +
The Satellite view doesn’t provide much information - the name of the recommendation, the severity of the risk, and if the recommendation has a playbook available to resolve the issue.  +
Not every recommendation or issue that Insights finds has a playbook, but most do.

If you want to see more details you either need to go to Insights on the Hybrid Cloud Console or view the associated knowledgebase article. +

* At the end of the row, to the right of `Playbook`, you will see three vertical dots - click this then select `View in Red Hat Insights`. +

image::Sat_Insights_Connected_ViewInsights.png[Sat_Insights_Connected_ViewInsights.png,100%,100%]

* This will open a new browser tab and prompt you to log in if you are not already logged in. +
Once logged in you will see the view of your host in the Advisor service in Insights. + 
This looks similar to what you saw in the Satellite UI, but more information is available. +
* Locate the postgresql database recommendation. +
* Click on the arrow to the left of the recommendation name to expand the details. +
This will show you:

* Why the issue was detected
* What you need to do to resolve the issue
* Any related knowledge base articles

In this case, the postgresql server was started, but a tuned profile was not applied which means that the performance of the database isn’t optimal.

image::Sat_Insights_Connected_HCCView.png[Sat_Insights_Connected_HCC_View.png,100%,100%]

Insights tells you that to fix this, you need to install the tuned package then apply the tuned profile for postgresql. + 
Insights includes step by step directions, or you can generate an ansible playbook inside of Insights. +
You will return to Red Hat Satellite to perform a remediation of this issue.

Before leaving, take note of the `Last seen` time and date of this system right above the word `Recommendations`, near the host name of the system.   This was the last time the host checked in with Insights.  By default this is a systemd process that happens once daily.

Do not close the Hybrid Cloud Console tab as you will return to it shortly.

== Fixing an issue that Insights finds

Return to your Satellite UI.  Hopefully this puts you at the Insights tab of the `node-{guid}-1.example.com` host. + 
If not, repeat the earlier steps of going to Hosts → All hosts then selecting `node-{guid}-1.example.com` and then the Insights tab. +

To start the process of fixing an issue, select the checkbox next to the postgresql recommendation. 
In this case, click the checkbox to the left of `The postgresql database performance decreases when the tuned best practices are not applied`.

Notice that the Remediate button at the top turns blue once a Recommendation is selected. +
Click the Remediate button. 

image::Sat_Insights_Connected_Remediate1.png[Sat_Insights_Connected_Remediate1.png,100%,100%]

This will open a window that will summarize the recommendation, the resolution, and will let you know if a reboot of the system is needed. +
In this case the resolution is to install the tuned package and set the proper tuned profile which does not require a reboot.

Click Remediate.

image::Sat_Insights_Connected_Remediate2.png[Sat_Insights_Connected_Remediate2.png,100%,100%]

This will redirect you to `Monitor → Jobs` where you can see the job running that you just initiated. 
This job may take 2-5 minutes to complete.  Wait for the results to show success.

image::Sat_Insights_Connected_JobSuccess.png[Sat_Insights_Connected_JobSuccess.png,60%,60%]

At the bottom of the page you will see a table that lists Host, Status, and Actions.
Click the Host name in the Host column.  This will show you the Ansible playbook that was run as part of this remote execution job.

image::Sat_Insights_Connected_JobDetails.png[Sat_Insights_Connected_JobDetails.png,60%,60%]

This job made sure the right repo was enabled, it installed the necessary package, it enabled the tuned profile, then it re-ran insights to detect that the issue was resolved.

Hopefully you still have the previous Hybrid Cloud Console tab open.  +
If not, open a new tab and go to the https://console.redhat.com/insights/advisor/systems[Systems page in the Advisor service^] and select `node-{guid}-1.example.com`.

Take a look at the `Last seen` time.  Notice that has been updated and the system has recently checked in with Insights.  In the remediation playbook the very last step was to `run insights`.  +
This had the system check back into Insights after making a fix and as a result if you look at the list of Recommendations, the postgresql issue that you resolved is no longer showing. +

Another way to check this is by going to the system inventory. +
On the left-hand navigation bar, click Inventory then Systems. +
Look through the list of systems and locate yours: `node-{guid}-1.example.com`

To the right of the name there is a `Last seen` time that should be within the last few minutes. +
Return to the Satellite UI.

On the Satellite left hand navigation bar, select Insights then Recommendations. +
Look at the number of risks listed - it is probably still 8 - the remediation that you just completed is not synchronized from Insights.  By default this only happens once daily, so you need to manually do this by clicking the three dots and selecting `Sync recommendations`.

After the recommendations have been synchronized the postgresql issue that you fixed on the 9.1 host is no longer listed.  You will still see the issue for the other host which we will resolve in the next module.

You have identified a situation that is outside of the best practices for your workload, you have resolved the issue, and Insights no longer reports it as being an issue for `node-{guid}-1.example.com`. 

This module is complete.
